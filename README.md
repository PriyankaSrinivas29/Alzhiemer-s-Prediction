# ALZHEIMERâ€™S PREDICTION 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. 
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates in the brain, including beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles. These protein deposits lead to the degeneration and death of brain cells.

### ARCHITECTURE
The CNN model is constructed using a combination of convolutional blocks and normalization blocks.
Input layers: The input layer specifies the shape of the input images.
Initial convolutional layers : It extract features from the input images. Initial convolutional layers act as feature detectors, identifying simple patterns and structures in the input images.
Convolutional blocks (conv_block) consist of convolutional layers, batch normalization, and max-pooling.
Flatten Layer: After the convolutional layers, a flatten layer is used to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, preparing the data for the fully connected layers.
Normalization blocks (norm_block) consist of a dense layer, batch normalization, and dropout.
